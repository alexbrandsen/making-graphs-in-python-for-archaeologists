To start, follow these steps:

- Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alexbrandsen/making-graphs-in-python-for-archaeologists/blob/main/making-graphs-and-plots.ipynb) 
- If needed, create a Google account and/or log in to your Google account
- You are now in a so called notebook, where you can run code
	- Run cells by pressing 'play' button, or press SHIFT+ENTER
